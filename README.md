For feature requests or bug reports, please visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/threecreepio/pannsson/issues).
 
## Major Version 6 (Current 6.0)

### New Features 
- All Night Nippon now uses IRQ handling rather than Sprite 0, meaning there will be less lag frames!
- Every 100th framerule is no longer broken, all framerules are now functional.
- Input Display added.

	- Fixed stack overflow bug in Lost Levels.
	- "100th Framerule" bug now fixed, thank you threecreepio.

	- Support for physical hardware.
	- Save states won't break PBs
	- Slow motion in Original doesn't brick Top Loader.
- Remove artifact in the statusbar where the bottom portion of certain letters would jitter with scrolling.
- There is no longer a horribly ugly flicker when you save or load states (unless you load from a level with a different background color than the save state).
- Fix "Restart Level" that would glitch Lost Levels in some scenarios.
- Fix bug where only parts of the font-set was copied if using a custom one.
- Lots of other smaller things...

## Persistence

To keep settings, frame rules and stuff persistent; configure your game
system (emulator, PowerPAK, EverDrive etc.) to allow the SMB Practice ROM
battery-backed WRAM. Essentially, figure out how to make it so that you can
save in Zelda (without savestates), power off the system, and load (without using save states). Then do the same for the SMB Practice ROM.

## Feature list
- Practice **All Night Nippon SMB**
- **Start** the game from **any frame rule**
- **Start** on **any level**.
- Keeps **track of prefered start rule** for each level.
- **Battery backed WRAM** for persistent memory.
	- Level rules.
	- One save state.
	- Settings.
- **Restart the level** from the **frame-rule** you entered.
- Monitor **two user-defined RAM addresses**.
- Built-in **save-states**.
- Customizable **hotkeys**.
- **In-game menu** with lots of stuff.
- **Pause** completely **freezes** the game (does not advance frame rules).
- **Advanced settings** menu in the loader.
- **Real-time** counter for each level, and persistent records.
- Start directly on the **Second Quest** in ANNSMB.
- And a lot more...
