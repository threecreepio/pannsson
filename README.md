 **Please note this version of the Practice ROM uses the MMC5 mapper, this ROM will not work with certain flashcarts such as KrzysioCart, or on cheap clone consoles.**
 
## Major Version 6 (Current 6.0)

### New Features 
- Lost Levels now uses IRQ handling rather than Sprite 0, meaning there will be less lag frames!
- Every 100th framerule is no longer broken, all framerules are now functional.
- FDS Minus World and NES Minus World added for those wanting to practice "Minus World Ending" and "Minus World NES". You can toggle between them in the settting menu.
- Input Display added.

- Fix "Restart Level" that would glitch Lost Levels in some scenarios.
- Fix bug where only parts of the font-set was copied if using a custom one.
- Lots of other smaller things...

## Persistence

To keep settings, frame rules and stuff persistent; configure your game
system (emulator, PowerPAK, EverDrive etc.) to allow the SMB Practice ROM
battery-backed WRAM. Essentially, figure out how to make it so that you can
save in Zelda (without savestates), power off the system, and load (without using save states). Then do the same for the SMB Practice ROM.

## Feature list
- Practice both **SMB** and **SMB Lost Levels**
- **Start** the game from **any frame rule**
- **Start** on **any level**.
- Keeps **track of prefered start rule** for each level.
- **Battery backed WRAM** for persistent memory.
	- Level rules.
	- One save state.
	- Personal bests.
	- Settings.
- **Restart the level** from the **frame-rule** you entered.
- Monitor **two user-defined RAM addresses**.
- Built-in **save-states**.
- Customizable **hotkeys**.
- **In-game menu** with lots of stuff.
- **Pause** completely **freezes** the game (does not advance frame rules).
- **Advanced settings** menu in the loader.
- **Real-time** counter for each level, and persistent records.
- Start directly on the **Second Quest** in SMB1.
- And a lot more...

## Download & Installation

First download the desired version below:

- [Version 6.0 - BPS](https://github.com/lain-web2000/pellsson-irq/raw/master/pellsson-2000.bps)

Then simply apply that BPS (using for instance Floating Lunar IPS) to the an original, unmodified version of the Super Mario Bros. (US/World) ROM. *DO NOT* use The Lost Levels. The MD5 checksum for the ROM you should be using is `811b027eaf99c2def7b933c5208636de`.

Have fun!
